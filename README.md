# Everbook templates for A4

I've been experimenting with the
[Everbook](https://everbookforever.com) loose-leaf organisation system
but many of the templates are in US Letter format, rather than
A4. This repo contains some converted templates and a new dotted page,
written in LaTeX, that resembles the Leuchtturm 1917 notebook style.
